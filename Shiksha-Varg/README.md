## Security, Authentication and Verification

Shiksha Varg uses a secure JWT system to maintain user sessions and ensure authorized usage. Users are divided into roles - `student`, `teacher` and `admin` which determine access control for the various features.

Sensitive keys, such as for database access and google services, are kept in an untracked `.env` environment file.

The application is restricted to the `.iiitm.ac.in` domain to prevent interference from external sources.

## Running The Application (Local Setup)

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashes-Mondal/apna-classroom.git
```

Install the node modules

```bash
cd frontend/
npm i

cd ../backend/
npm i
```

At this point you can add a .env file in the backend directory. Ensure that you arer still in the backend directpry, and now we can run the application by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
